            <p>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and have a strong passion for the customizing aspects of the craft.
                Providing each clientâ€™s product with a unique individuality that they can be proud of has been my goal
                since day one.</p>

            <p>Strong communication is the quality I have always held in the highest regard. Creating functional
                applications is a
                team effort, and the ability to receive and provide clear and precise critique is the optimal path
                towards
                accomplishing a task. I have always enjoyed working directly with the marketing elements of the team to
                ensure full
                scale functionality within the company goal.</p>

            <p>I have always had the heart of a marketing team member but the mind of a developer, this approach has
                always provided
                congruency between the products I develop and the goals of the next people in line to use them. These
                aspects of my
                work ethic have stemmed from my extracurricular interests, being a life long musician has given me a
                unique
                perspective on the notion that functionality and marketability always work side by side. One of these
                company
                desires is useless without the other, which is why I take pride in my ability to consider the full end
                game while
                developing my products.</p>
